# Components

* [AM2302 DHT22 Humidity and Temperature Sensor Module](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-Precision-AM2302-DHT22-Digital-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-Module-For-arduino-Uno-R3/32759158558.html)
* [Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 Main Board (Clone)](https://www.jaycar.com.au/wifi-mini-esp8266-main-board/p/XC3802)
* [4x AA Switched Battery Enclosure](https://www.jaycar.com.au/4aa-switched-battery-enclosure/p/PH9282)

# Code
## Dependencies
These need to be installed as libraries accessible to the Arduino IDE.
* Arduino ESP8266 Libraries. If you have an ESP8266 set up with Arduino IDE, you probably have this. I followed instructions from [here](https://www.jaycar.com.au/medias/sys_master/images/9205492940830/XC3802-manualMain.pdf).
* [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) for MQTT
* [Adafruit DHT Sensor Library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library/), which also requires the [Adafruit Unified Sensor Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor)
