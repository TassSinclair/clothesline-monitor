# Code
## Dependencies
These need to be installed as libraries accessible to the Arduino IDE.
* Arduino ESP8266 Libraries. If you have an ESP8266 set up with Arduino IDE, you probably have this. I followed instructions from [here](https://www.jaycar.com.au/medias/sys_master/images/9205492940830/XC3802-manualMain.pdf).
* [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) for MQTT
* [Adafruit DHT Sensor Library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library/), which also requires the [Adafruit Unified Sensor Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor)
